Gifts are not just a great way to brighten the day of your friends, but they're also a great way to express your individuality! The Gifty mod gives you near limitless possible combinations of gift boxes, lids, and ribbons to create the perfect gift. 

To begin, you will need to craft a <a href=\'handbook://block-gifty:giftboxbase-plain\'>simple giftbox</a> and a <a href=\'handbook://block-gifty:giftboxlid-plain\'>simple lid</a>. These will be the basis for all other designs. 
    
Secondly, <a href=\'handbooksearch://cloth fragment\'>cloth fragments</a> and coloured cloth will be needed to customize your gift box and lid into the many designs created by the Vintage Story community. Fragments are created by clipping them out of full cloth using <a href=\'handbooksearch://shears\'>shears</a> in the crafting grid. Simply open the handbook, search for your favourite <a href=\'handbooksearch://gift box\'>gift box design</a> and follow the recipe to create something special!  

Once both gift box and lid are created, place the box in-world. You will then be able to place the lid right on top. This will create a single-slot inventory that you can open, just like any other inventory. Inside, you can place any special gift(including coal) for your friends. Or nothing at all, for the memes!

Now, to seal the inventory, you need a coloured <a href=\'handbooksearch://ribbon\'>ribbon</a>! With ribbon in-hand, <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> the gift and it will become wrapped. Now you can carry it around with you by picking it up with <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> and give it to your very special someone.

If you want to include a message for your recipient, a <a href=\'handbook://item-gifty:giftcard-unsigned\'>gift card</a> can be used to attach one! This is also perfect for additional security. The first box can be used to address your recipient by name, for example, 'Dear Taska'. The second box can be used to write any message you like! When you hit the 'Sign Card' button your name will automatically be written to the card.

With a signed gift card in hand, interact with a gift box using <icon name='rightmousebutton'></icon> to assign it. This can be done before or after it has been wrapped with ribbon. If a mistake was made, the gifter can always assign a new signed gift card.

The season of giving lasts year-round with Gifty!",
